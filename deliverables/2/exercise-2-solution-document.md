## 1. Oracle Selection Solution

### The Challenge
Your institution faces a critical decision: which oracle provider(s) can be trusted with NAV calculations that directly impact regulatory compliance and investor confidence?

### Our Recommendation: Hybrid Multi-Oracle Architecture

#### How We Help You Select Oracle Providers
**Key Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Track Record**: Years operating, value secured, incident history
- **Data Quality**: Direct source vs aggregated, update frequency
- **Asset Coverage**: Treasuries, money markets, repos, commercial paper
- **Architecture**: Decentralized nodes, redundancy, failover mechanisms
- **Pricing Model**: Subscription vs per-query, scalability with AUM
- **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for price discovery

#### Our Recommended Architecture
```
Multi-Oracle Strategy:
- Oracle 1: Primary price feed (highest reliability)
- Oracle 2: Secondary validation (different methodology)
- Oracle 3: Tertiary verification (independent source)

Validation Layer:
- Cross-oracle consensus (2% deviation threshold)
- Sanity checks against reference prices
- Proof of Reserves integration for underlying assets
```

#### Oracle Providers to Consider
- **Chainlink**: Market leader, $20B+ secured, institutional partnerships
- **Pyth Network**: Sub-second updates from major trading firms  
- **Redstone**: Modular oracle supporting traditional finance assets
- **Band Protocol**: Alternative oracle with broad coverage

#### Why This Architecture Wins
1. **No Single Point of Failure**: Multiple independent data sources
2. **Manipulation Resistance**: Requires compromising multiple oracles simultaneously
3. **Regulatory Defensible**: Demonstrates robust price discovery to SEC
4. **Provider Flexibility**: Can swap oracles without architecture changes
5. **Flexibility**: Mix premium and comprehensive providers

## 2. Security Concerns Specific to Tokenized MMFs

### Critical Risk Areas

#### A. NAV Calculation Integrity
**Risk**: Incorrect NAV leads to mispricing, regulatory violations
**Mitigation**: 
- Multi-oracle consensus with outlier rejection
- Time-weighted average pricing (TWAP)
- Real-time deviation monitoring via OpenZeppelin Monitor

#### B. Liquidity Management
**Risk**: Bank run scenario, inability to meet redemptions
**Mitigation**:
- Smart contract-enforced redemption gates
- Liquidity buffer requirements (10% minimum)
- Automated rebalancing via Relayer

#### C. Regulatory Compliance (SEC Rule 2a-7)
**Risk**: Violating weighted average maturity/life limits
**Mitigation**:
- On-chain enforcement of WAM ≤ 60 days
- Automated portfolio composition monitoring
- Real-time compliance reporting

#### D. Interest Rate Risk
**Risk**: Negative rates in Europe affecting portfolio
**Mitigation**:
- Smart contract floors at 0%
- Automated hedging triggers
- Geographic diversification controls

#### E. Operational Security
**Risk**: Key compromise, unauthorized operations
**Mitigation**:
- Hardware Security Module integration
- Multi-signature requirements
- Time-locked administrative functions
